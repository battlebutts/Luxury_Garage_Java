Warning:
For some reason, when using Search to pick up your car, the Scene will appear blank. Resizing it by 1px minimum will fix this. 
After hours of debugging, I gave up on it and figured it was some odd Java bug.


Layout:

File -
	New - Opens new ParkingGarage
	Save - Saves current Garage
	Open - Loads saved file
Edit -
	Valet - Parks car in first available spot
	Pickup Car -
		Search by Ticket - searches for your car VIA your ticket number
		Search by Plate - searches for your car VIA your licsense plate
Help -
	About - my information

	
How to work:
Very obvious you park and pick up cars. Just remember to attempt to write down your ticket# for searching. There is also a print
in the console for your ticket number with respective space.
